This is my tech demo site of Cando-site, to demonstrate my full understanding of Vue and Vuex, and probably the project I spent the most time on.
I cannot share details on how to completely operate this because it feeds from my database in Firebase, you can find the link to a demo somewhere on this page. 
Running the command: npx npm run serve, starts the application in the terminal of your VSC.
